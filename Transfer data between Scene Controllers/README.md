##This is a small project the aim of which is to practice the three ways to transfer data between Scene Controllers in JavaFX

1. "setUserData()" and "getUserData()" methods:
   These methods can be used to send an and receive an "Object" when the class extends the "Node" class 
   
2. Setter and Getter methods:
   Create an instance of the controller class and set the data, then manually set the instance as the controller of the opened scene
   
3. Singleton classes:
   Create a singleton to hold the required data

#The application is a BMI (body mass index) calculator.
